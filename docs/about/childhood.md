<h1 style="color: #DC4D01;">Early Life</h1>


Growing up in Naples, Italy, I was surrounded by the cityâ€™s rich artistic heritage and vibrant culture, which sparked my early love for visual art. From a young age, I found myself drawn to drawing, sketching, and experimenting with color and form. This passion only grew as I discovered digital tools, which opened up a whole new world of creative possibilities.

My early years were filled with a mix of traditional art practice and self-taught exploration in graphic design. I would spend hours studying the details of my favorite illustrations and experimenting with different software, slowly building my skills and developing a personal style. The support of my family and teachers encouraged me to pursue art seriously, leading me to enroll at the Accademy of Fine arts of Naples.

These formative years gave me a strong foundation in both the classic and modern aspects of art, fueling my drive to explore the possibilities within the fields of design and illustration.
